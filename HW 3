EXERCISE 2

2.1
What scores and statistics does BLAST use? What does each one mean and 
how is it calculated? 

The P-value is used to indicate significance in global sequence comparisions.

Gapped alignments rely on pre-estimation parameters lambda and K.

For local sequence, we can also look at HSP scores. The equation: E = Kmn*e^(-lambda*s) with M and N are sequence lengths.
K and Lambda are natural scales for search space. The E value decreases exponentially with score. The score is 
normalized with: S'= (lambda*S*ln(k))/(ln(2))

We plug this into the E value: E=m*n*2^(-S)

Using the HSP score from above, we can find the p-value through: (e^(-E))*(E^(a)/a!))
and P=1-e^-E

2.2
What is the difference between BLAST, BLAST 2, PSI-BLAST, FASTA? When 
should each of these been used (trade-offs?) 

BLAST is basic local alignment search tool and is used to calculate the similarity of sequences and comparing primary sequence information
BLAST has input nucleotide that's queried against a larger sequence. Variations exist in BLAST and often regarded as slower 
but has better resulsts for higher scores of matching. 

BLAST2 is similar to BLAST but can have gaps. Used to search for homologous sequences in nucleotide and protein databases.  BLAST2 utilizes the BLAST algorithm for DNA-DNA or protein-protein sequence comparison.    

PSI-Blast is Position-Specific Iterated BLAST and a more specialized BLAST sequence for using protein queries to find other members of the same protein family.  The trade-off is the focus on proteins and not on other types of entities. 

FASTA is DNA and protein sequence alignment. It primarily uses local alignments to find matches and is faster but results may not be as good.  
The differences are that for closely matched sequences Blast is very accurate and for dissimilar â€¨sequence Fasta is better software. Blast also uses FASTA input to get the output and can be slower compared to FASTA.

2.3
Explain what is the p-value for the top match of the following query (that
actually comes from the movie Jurassic Park): 
Go through the calculations and see if the p-value matches the one reported by 
BLAST. If you have to make any assumptions please state them explicitly.  

As we saw from earlier, the P-Value is used to find the probability of a HSP.
  
P=1-e^(-E)

When the E=Value is less than 0.01, the scores are approximately the same. Also, the E-Values are generally more readable compared to P-Values.  

From the calculations on the DinoDNA the E-Value is less than 0.01 and converts to a P-value which is almost 0.  This would indicate that the matching randomly probability is close to none and that it's statisically significant.  

The P-Value is not reported as the E-Value is the one that is reported.
