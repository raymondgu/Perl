PART A
1.1
Removing the first \n will cause the output to be :Welcome to PerlTATA is a box. Removing the 2nd will do the same thing. \t before Welcome will cause it to shift one tab to the right. Changing from " " to ' ' will cause everything to print on one line even if \n is used. No quotations at all will cause a syntax error. 

Output: 
#Output:
#Welcome to Perl
#TATA is a box

prints the RNA above the DNA string

1.4
The translate function switches the lowercase t with the uppercase T.

No, the c command is used as a complement. Any character specified is then kept and the other characters are replaced with the desired character.

count is 10

PART B
1.	What is NCBI, Entrez, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)

NCBI is the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Entrez Global Query Cross Database search system is a search engine for health science databases. GEO is a genomics data repository.
2.	What is Blast and what FASTA ? What are the differences of these two.

Blast and FASTA are both software used to compare DNA sequences except Blast is faster and more accurate than FASTA. Blast can be modified but Fasta cannot. 
3. Write down the names of at least their sequence alignment algorithms and their main differences

Blast uses the Heuristic algorithm and Fasta uses the Smith-Waterman algorithm. The main difference is that the Blast may miss hard to find matches. Smith Waterman is more accurate but its also more time consuming. 
4.	What is PubMed? What other ways exist to do the same thing?

PubMed is a search engine that accesses the MEDLINE database. Gen Bank, Medscape and DrugInfo also are databases/search engines.
PART C
Find how many times ELVIS appears in the protein database SWISSPROT, how many 
times LIVES appears, and how many time they appear consecutively. Do ELVIS and DEAD 
appear together? How many times does PERL appear? Does PERLISGREAT appear? What 
would it mean if any of these longer statements did appear in the the protein files?

ELVIS:

LIVES:

It would be due to proteins being combined within the database. 
PART D
Perl Script to convert a file from FASTQ to FASTA. Use file sample.fasq

#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Input file name":
$fastq = <>;
open IN, "$fastq";
print "Please input the name of the file to print \n";
$fasta = <>;
open OUT, ">$fasta";
while ($line1 = <IN>)
{
	$line1 =~ tr/@/>/;
	print OUT "$line1';
	$line2 = <IN>;
	print OUT "$line2";
	$line3 = <IN>;
	$line4 = <IN>;
}
close (IN);
close (OUT);

Convert FASTA to FASTQ
#!usr/bin/perl
#
#fasta2q
#
print "Please input the name of the fastq file. \n";
$fasta = <>;
open IN, "$fasta";
print "Please input the name of the file to print to. \n";
$fastq = <>;
open OUT, ">$fastq";
while ($line1 = <IN>)
{        $line1 =~ tr/>/@/;
          print OUT "$line1";
          ($line2 = <IN>);
          print OUT "$line2";
          ($line3 = <IN>);
          print OUT "+ \n";
          ($line4 = <IN>);
          $line2 =~ tr/ACGT/BBBB/;
          print OUT "$line2";
}
close (IN);
close (OUT);

B is an encoding for the value 2 for Phred Score in the Illumia test based encoding. The probability of nucleobase read at postion B is calculated using P= 10^(-Q/10) where Q is the quality score.
